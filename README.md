# Spacecraft Dynamics Playground

This project is a playground. It helps me improve at maths and physics, and have a real fun learning kinematics and other topics related to space travel.

For now, we ignore physics (there is no gravity field), and focus on an ideal spaceship with infinite thrust, capable of constant acceleration at a given G.
The spaceship is given an initial and a final position (in 3D), as well as an initial and a final velocity (on the same axis as its direction). It will decelerate in time to reach its destination with the expected velocity.

# Tools

- Sympy
- Plotly

# Roadmap

- Inertia (probably using dyadics)
- Moving bodies (planets and other orbiting bodies)
- Closed-loop control
- Gravity and thrust energy
- Directed thrust and attitude description
